# Traveling Salesman Problem Solver with Quantum Computing

This project utilizes quantum computing to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a well-known optimization problem. The solution involves encoding the problem into quantum circuits and applying reinforcement learning techniques like Q-learning to find approximate solutions efficiently.

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Ensure Python dependencies are installed (`torch`, `numpy`, `networkx`, `qiskit`, etc.), in the own Jupyter notebook there are some cells dedicated to the necessary installations.
2. **Execution**: Run the main Jupyter notebook (TSP_MLAY_) cells to train the model and solve TSP instances.
3. **Customization**: Adjust parameters, model architecture, or quantum circuit configurations for different TSP instances or experiments.
