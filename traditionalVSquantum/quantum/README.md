# Quantum Repository

This repository contains various components related to quantum computing experiments and simulations.

## Folder Structure

1. **docs/**
   - *Currently empty.*
   - This folder is reserved for documentation related to the project.

2. **out_metrics/**
   - *Currently empty.*
   - This folder will store metrics and performance measurements obtained from experiments.

3. **out_plots/**
   - Contains visual outputs in the form of plots.
   - **Comparative Plot (plot.jpg):** Displays the performance comparison between different models for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using quantum computing.

4. **src/**
   - Contains the main source code and notebooks.
   - **Notebook (TSP_MLAY.ipynb):** Jupyter notebook containing code for quantum computing experiments and simulations.
   - The notebook includes explanations and comments alongside the code for clarity and understanding.

## Description

This repository is structured to facilitate experimentation and analysis of quantum computing models, specifically for solving combinatorial optimization problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The folders `docs` and `out_metrics` are placeholders for future documentation and metrics storage, respectively. The `out_plots` folder already contains a comparative plot illustrating the performance differences between different models. The `src` folder houses the main notebook where the quantum computing code is implemented and explained.

## Usage

- **docs/**: Once populated, this folder will contain project documentation, including user guides, technical specifications, and research notes.
- **out_metrics/**: Future metrics and performance data will be stored here as experiments progress and results are obtained.
- **out_plots/**: View the comparative plot (`plot.jpg`) to analyze and compare the performance of different models.
- **src/**: Access the notebook (`TSP_MLAY.ipynb`) to explore and experiment with quantum computing code implementations and simulations.
