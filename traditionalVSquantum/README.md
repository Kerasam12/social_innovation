# Project: Quantum vs Traditional Computing Comparison

This repository compares quantum and traditional computing approaches for solving various computational problems. It includes implementations and analyses in both quantum and traditional paradigms.

## Folder Structure

The project is organized into two main folders: `quantum` and `traditional`. Each folder contains the following subfolders:

1. **docs/**
   - **Description**: This folder is intended for documentation files. Currently empty for both folders.

2. **out_metrics/**
   - **Description**: This folder is intended to store output metrics generated during experiments. Currently empty for both folders.

3. **out_plots/**
   - **Description**: This folder contains visual plots for the quantum or traditional approaches.

4. **src/**
   - **Description**: This folder contains the source code and notebooks for quantum or traditional implementations.
